# The CS note of learned courses

## Data Structure & Algorithm
### [Princeton Algorithm I]()

Algorithm I is mainly focuses on the elementary method, like sort, trees, hash tables. I learnt a lot from this course. For each algorithm the author will demostrate the background, then distribute the algorithm step by step. Eventually, the algorithm will be analysed by using the BigO notation from space and time complexity. Learning algorithm itself is not that difficult, it's the evolution of algothm that matters. Especially the background of the algorithm and what problem of this algorithm solved.

For instance, pick the smallest n-th number in an unsorted list. If I didn't know [Quick Selection Algorthim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect), I would use sort first, then try to find the final answer. The answer is always the same, but the resource usage is different, like CPU, memory, etc.
